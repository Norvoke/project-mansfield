The biggest downside is the location—it’s kind of far from most buildings, and weekends can be a hassle since Atwater’s closed, so getting food isn’t the easiest. Also, there’s no laundry in the building, so you’ll have to go to Coffrin or Atwater A to get that done.",

    "review": "Gifford has been the most memorable dorm that I've lived in while at midd. I think it is one of the best locations for sophomores to live in, especially sophomore febs. I think this because its place in the middle of campus, along with being close so close to the Chapel, to the Student Center, and to the lecture halls where I had classes at the time. I would say if you are planning on majoring in any of the 'humanities', Giff is high up on where you should hangout. It hosts WOMP, the Wednesday open mic party every week in the gamut room in the basement. The main issue with Giff being so centrally located is that it is not the quietest space nor the best furnished—it being one of the oldest dorms on campus.",

This means it has good parking nearby, it is relatively quiet at all times, and that the amenities (bathrooms, kitchens, elevators, etc) are some of the best on campus. Forest being very close to the center of campus is a big plus too and factored heavily in my choice to live there my Junior year.",
